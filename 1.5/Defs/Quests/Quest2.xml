				<!-- quest description -->
				<li>questDescription->According to the data extracted on the old prototype site, we managed to find the location of an [adj] industrial complex where construction of the [arcName] continued. This sprawling facility was once bustling with engineers and scientists pushing the boundaries of technology, but now it stands in silence, overtaken by the passage of time.\n\nThe site contains [siteDetails], but it is now [siteThreat].\n\n[studyWarning] [questFailWarning]\n\nSuccessfully completing this expedition [questOutcome].</li>

				<li>questDescription->Data from the prototype site revealed the coordinates of an [adj] industrial yard, where the [arcName] was further developed by [inventor_nameFull] and their team. The facility stretches across a vast expanse, its rusting frames and crumbling walls hinting at its former glory.\n\nWithin the complex are [siteDetails], but [siteThreat] must be dealt with before any meaningful research can be done.\n\n[studyWarning] [questFailWarning]\n\nResolving this task [questOutcome].</li>

				<li>questDescription->Analyzing the prototype’s data, we’ve pinpointed the location of an [adj] construction yard that served as the next step in the [arcName] project. This site, once a beacon of industrial ambition, is now a graveyard of innovation, its machinery left to decay under the open sky.\n\nInside, you’ll find [siteDetails], but it is [siteThreat].\n\n[studyWarning] [questFailWarning]\n\nYour efforts here [questOutcome].</li>

				<li>questDescription->The data retrieved from the old prototype has led us to an [adj] industrial complex that was pivotal in advancing the [arcName] project. Once a thriving hub of technological development, the facility now lies in ruin, its halls echoing only with the wind.\n\nAmong the remnants are [siteDetails], though the complex has become [siteThreat].\n\n[studyWarning] [questFailWarning]\n\nCompleting this mission [questOutcome].</li>

				<!-- study warnings -->
				<li>studyWarning->Careful examination of the area is required to uncover valuable information.</li>
				<li>studyWarning->You must study the ancient machines and generator components carefully.</li>
				<li>studyWarning->To gain insights, you'll need to investigate the research notes and generator parts thoroughly.</li>
				<li>studyWarning->Thorough investigation is key to retrieving useful data from the site.</li>
				<li>studyWarning->The data here could be critical, so every effort must be made to study the area thoroughly.</li>

				<!-- quest failure warnings -->
				<li>questFailWarning->If more than half of the studiable machines and notes are destroyed, the mission will fail.</li>
				<li>questFailWarning->Too much damage to the complex will result in failure.</li>
				<li>questFailWarning->Destroying too many research materials will cause the mission to fail.</li>
				<li>questFailWarning->Failure to preserve enough studiable components will end the mission.</li>
				<li>questFailWarning->Be mindful of your actions; the mission hinges on preserving the site's integrity.</li>

				<!-- quest outcomes -->
				<li>questOutcome->could lead us to the actual ARC location.</li>
				<li>questOutcome->may uncover the true ARC site.</li>
				<li>questOutcome->might point us to the final ARC project.</li>
				<li>questOutcome->should reveal the next steps to find the ancient ARC.</li>
				<li>questOutcome->will bring us closer to uncovering the secrets of the ARC.</li>
